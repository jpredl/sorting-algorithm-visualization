# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

Watch your favorite sorting algorithms do what they do best!

## About
A simple application for the visualization and analysis of various sorting algorithms. Written in python and using the Tkinter library.

## Features
1. Initiation of various kinds of unsorted data, for example fully permutated data, locally permutated data or reverse-ordered data.

2. Visualization of various sorting algorithms. Available algorithms are Selectionsort, Bubblesort and Quicksort.

3. Simple extensibility of other sorting algorithms. Simply implement your sorting algorithm using the Sorter class.


## Run
To run this application execute main.py. The only dependency is numpy.
